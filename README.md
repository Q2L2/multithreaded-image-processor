# Multithreaded Image Processor

A work-in-progress multithreaded image processing project for the PPM format images implemented in C, designed to demonstrate data structures, algorithms, and learned in coursework and multithreading learned online.

## Features
- Processes images using multiple threads to improve performance on larger files.

## Known Issues
Very large images may fail due to memory limitations.

Some functions are experimental and may not cover all edge cases.

## Future Improvements

Optimize multithreading thresholds for different image sizes.

Add proper memory leak handling and testing.

Extend support for additional image formats and operations.

## Acknowledgements
Developed as part of undergraduate coursework in C programming, data structures, and algorithms.
